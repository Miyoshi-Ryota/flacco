\title{Calculate Basic Features}
\usage{
calculateBasicFeatures(feat.object)
}
\arguments{
\item{feat.object}{[\code{\link{FeatureObject}}]\cr
A feature object as created by \link{createFeatureObject}.\cr}
}
\value{
[\code{\link{list}(16)} of \code{\link{numeric}(1)}].\cr
List of features.\cr
For further information, see details.
}
\description{
Lists features based on the initial design and objective values.
}
\details{
Simple basic information, given by the initial design:\cr

(1) \code{dim}: dimension of the decision space\cr
(2) \code{observations}: number of observations\cr
(3) \code{lower.min}: minimum of all lower bounds\cr
(4) \code{lower.max}: maximum of all lower bounds\cr
(5) \code{upper.min}: minimum of all upper bounds\cr
(6) \code{upper.max}: maximum of all upper bounds\cr
(7) \code{objective.min}: minimum of objective values (within the initial
design)\cr
(8) \code{objective.max}: maximum of objective values (within the initial
design)\cr
(9) \code{blocks.min}: minimum number of blocks\cr
(10) \code{blocks.max}: maximum number of blocks\cr
(11) \code{cells.total}: total number of cells\cr
(12) \code{cells.filled}: number of non-empty cells\cr
(13) \code{allows_cm}: does the feature object support cell mapping?\cr
(14) \code{minimize_fun}: should the objective be minimized?\cr

The final two features show the amount of (additional) function
evaluations and running time (in seconds) that were needed for the
computation of these features.

\examples{
# (1) create the initial design:
X = t(replicate(1000, runif(2, -10, 10)))
y = apply(X, 1, function(x) sum(x^2))
feat.object = createFeatureObject(X = X, y = y)

# (2) compute the basic features:
calculateBasicFeatures(feat.object)
